    <summary><strong>TL;DR</strong></summary>
    <p>This article explores the delicate process of brewing the perfect cup of tea, considering water temperature, steeping time, and the differences between tea varieties.</p>

  <h2>The Essentials of Tea Making</h2>
  <p>Tea, a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions around the world, is both an art and a science. While seemingly simple, brewing the perfect cup requires attention to detail and a touch of finesse. Whether you fancy a robust black tea or prefer the subtle notes of green tea, understanding the essentials of tea making can elevate your tea experience.</p>
  <h3>Choosing the Right Tea</h3>
  <p>Every great cup of tea begins with selecting the ideal tea leaves. The variety of tea you choose significantly influences the final flavour and aroma. Black tea, for instance, is known for its strong, bold taste, whereas green tea offers a more delicate, vegetal flavour. Herbal teas, on the other hand, deliver a range of floral and fruity tastes. Experimenting with different types will help you find the perfect fit for your palate.</p>
  <h3>Water Temperature Matters</h3>
  <p>Water is the essence of tea, making the temperature at which it's boiled crucial. Different teas require different temperatures to release their optimal flavours. Boiling water is suitable for black and herbal teas, but can ruin delicate green or white teas. These should be brewed with water heated to a lower temperature, around 70-80°C. Investing in a temperature-controlled kettle can ensure precision and enhance your brewing experience.</p>

  <h3>The Art of Steeping</h3>
  <p>Timing is everything when it comes to steeping tea. Too long, and your tea may taste bitter; too short, and it might be weak and lacking depth. As a general rule of thumb, black teas should steep for 3-5 minutes, while green teas need only 2-3 minutes. Always follow the specific instructions for your chosen tea, as these can vary depending on the leaves' origin and processing.</p>
  <h3>Finishing Touches</h3>
  <p>The beauty of tea lies in personalisation. After mastering the basics, consider adding your own special touches. A squeeze of lemon can brighten up a cup of black tea, while a spoonful of honey can enhance the natural sweetness of herbal teas. Some might prefer a splash of milk in strong English Breakfast tea, adding richness and creaminess to the brew.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the perfect cup of tea is one that you enjoy. Take these guidelines as a starting point, then let your tastebuds lead the way. Happy brewing!</p>
