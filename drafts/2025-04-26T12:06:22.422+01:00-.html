    <h2>Understanding the Basics: Tea Types and Their Nuances</h2>
    <p>Tea might be a ubiquitous beverage around the world, but brewing an impeccable cup is not as straightforward as it seems. Different types of tea demand varying brewing techniques to realise their full potential. Let's delve into the basics.</p>
    <p>At its core, tea can be categorised into several main types: black, green, white, oolong, and herbal infusions. Each type has its unique flavour profile, colour, and health benefits. For instance, black tea is often robust and full-bodied, whereas green tea offers a more delicate palate.</p>
    <h3>Temperature Matters</h3>
    <p>Temperature plays a crucial role in tea brewing. For black and herbal teas, boiling water (100°C) is required to extract the right flavours. Green and white teas, however, are best brewed at cooler temperatures ranging from 70°C to 85°C to prevent scalding and preserve their delicate flavours.</p>

    <h3>The Art of Timing</h3>
    <p>Brewing time is another critical factor. Over-steeping can result in a bitter cup, while under-steeping may leave the tea tasting thin and flavourless. Generally, black tea should steep for 3-5 minutes, green tea for 2-3 minutes, and herbal teas may require longer, around 5-7 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Techniques for the Perfect Brew</h2>
    <p>Embarking on your tea journey, it's vital to have the right tools and techniques at your disposal. Here are a few tips to elevate your tea brewing skills.</p>
    <h3>Choosing Quality Leaves</h3>
    <p>The quality of your tea leaves is paramount. Opt for loose leaf teas as they are generally higher quality compared to tea bags, allowing full leaves to unfurl and release their complete flavour.</p>
    <p>Invest in a good tea infuser or teapot with a built-in strainer to allow water circulation around the leaves, ensuring a well-rounded brew.</p>
    <h3>Water Quality</h3>
    <p>Finally, let's not overlook water quality. Ideally, use freshly drawn filtered or spring water, as the minerals can impact the taste of the tea. Avoid distilled water as it can make your tea taste flat.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, crafting the perfect cup of tea is an enjoyable and rewarding ritual. With attention to detail and a little practice, you'll be able to brew a cup that's not only satisfying and flavourful but also caters to your personal taste preferences. So, warm up that teapot and start experimenting!</p>
