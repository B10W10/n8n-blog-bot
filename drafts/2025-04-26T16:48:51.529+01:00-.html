  <h2>A Brew of History and Elegance</h2>
  
  <p>The humble cup of tea is more than just a beverage; it's a beloved ritual steeped in history and tradition. Whether you're a tea veteran or a casual sipper, understanding the nuances of tea-making can transform your regular cup into a delightful experience.</p>
  
  <h3>Choosing the Right Tea</h3>
  <p>Your journey begins with selecting the right tea leaves. Are you in the mood for a robust black tea, a soothing green, or perhaps a delicate white blend? The variety you choose sets the foundation for your brew's flavour and strength.</p>
  
  <h3>The Importance of Water Temperature</h3>

  <p>Water temperature plays a crucial role in tea making. Generally, black and herbal teas benefit from boiling water, while green and white teas prefer cooler temperatures, usually around 70-85°C. Water that's too hot can scorch the leaves, leading to bitterness.</p>
  
  <h3>Steeping to Perfection</h3>
  <p>Steep time is another vital factor in brewing the perfect cup. Black teas typically require 3-5 minutes, while green and white variants do best with a shorter 2-3 minutes. Experimenting with time can help you discover the perfect balance that suits your palate.</p>
  
  <p>The perfect cup of tea can be achieved with practice and patience. Each step, from selecting your leaves to controlling water temperature and timing, contributes to the end result—an aromatic, flavourful brew that soothes and invigorates.</p>
